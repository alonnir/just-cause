# just-cause
A curated list of just the right amount of resources on causal inference.
<br>
**WIP**
<br>

### Intro
Not another awesome list.

While awesome lists can indeed be awesome, they can also be daunting and evoke a strong sense of FOMO. This repo's mission is to be a snack size version of an awesome list, providing a highly curated, human friendly, and most importantly digestible list of resources for anyone interested in causal inference.

The idea here is that unlike an awesome list, one can definitely get though all the resources here, and come out the other end knowledgeable and happy.

Still want the awesome list? [Look](https://github.com/matthewvowels1/Awesome-Causal-Inference) [no](https://github.com/napsternxg/awesome-causality) [further](https://github.com/rguo12/awesome-causality-algorithms).

**We want you!** This repo is still at a very nascent stage. If you would like to contribute to `just-cause` and believe in the concise awesome lists cause, we would love to hear from you!

### Intro to Causal Inference
- The golden standard
- When you can't experiment
  -  Correlation does not mean causation


### Tools

Note - similar tools might go by different names, depending on legacy conventions in 
fields of research: Computer Science, Social Sciences, Health, Economics. 

With time we hope to map between names, but for now just register those important to be aware of.

- Before/After analysis
- Diff-in-diff
- Propensity score matching
- Synthetic controls
- Instrumental variables
- Fixed effects regression
- Regression discontinuity design
- Cluster randomised trials


### Books
- [*The Book of Why*](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) - popular science reading
- [Causal Inference in Statistics A Primer](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/) - excellent short technical book 
- [Causal Inference The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/) - Social Science focused using R and Strata
- [What If?](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) - a cohesive presentation of concepts of, and methods for, causal inference 

### MOOCs
- [*A Crash Course in Causality: Inferring Causal Effects from Observational Data*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality) / Coursera/ University of Pennsylvania - learn Propensity Score Matching, Instrumental Variables and Causal Inference


### Posts
- [*Start Asking Your Data 'Why?' - A Gentle Intro To Causal Inference*](https://elzurdo.github.io/2021/09/29/start_ask_why_part1.html)
- [*Causal design patterns for data analysts*](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/causal-design-patterns/)

### Packages
- [`DAGitty`](http://dagitty.net/) - R package to draw and analyze causal diagrams 
- [`pgmpy`](https://pgmpy.org/) - Implementation for Bayesian Networks with a focus on modularity and extensibility. Can use for *do-algebra*.
